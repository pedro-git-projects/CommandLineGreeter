# Random String Echoer

## Objective 

This is a simple Shell Script I made to randomly select a string from an array and echo it.
It has an associated function because I created it to print Marcus Aurelius quotes on my terminal.

## Usage

Just ensure that the script is executable using either

```shell
chmod 755
```
or

```shell
chmod + x
```
then save the function and call it on your bashrc or zshrc.
